## SurveyBlox Ltd.

Its only me, buildinger that runs all the repos. I maintain the surveyblox.com website as well the backend, and also the database.

Heres some stuff that I use for SurveyBlox:
  🌐 Website: Nuxt
  💻 Websocket server: C++, everything is custom built by me, apart from the OS
  🗄️ Database: Apache Cassandra
  ☁️ Cloudflare: I use domain, proxy, load balancing, agro from Cloudflare
  🖥️ Oracle: They host all of our servers

You can commit to any repository, just follow how I style code.
