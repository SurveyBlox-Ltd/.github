## SurveyBlox Ltd.

It's only me buildinger, running all the repos. I maintain the [surveyblox.com](https://surveyblox.com) website as well as the backend and the database.

Here are some things I use for SurveyBlox:

- 🌐 **Website**: Nuxt
- 💻 **Websocket server**: C++, everything custom-built by me, apart from the OS
- 🗄️ **Database**: Apache Cassandra
- ☁️ **Cloudflare**: Domain, proxy, load balancing, and agro
- 🖥️ **Oracle**: Hosting all of our servers

You can commit to any repository, just follow how I style the code.
